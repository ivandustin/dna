# TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## Abstract

A small programming language based on Lambda Calculus, inspired by GOD from His design of the DNA. This is designed to execute in a highly parallel manner by default and automatically. This is a compiled, statically typed language and uses automatic type inference. This is a general purpose high-level programming language. It compiles to C++ to create machine code.

This uses un-named lambda calculus, but uses synonyms. Therefore, all lambdas are inlined at the call site during compile time.
